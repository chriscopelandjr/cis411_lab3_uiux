## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score (1-5) | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| [indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/) | 4/5 | The login process was streamlined with sso google capabilities, next it asked me if I was an employee or a employer, Then it asked me where I was located and what the minium pay I was looking for and what job I was looking for. I was then presented with a list of jobs and when I clicked the apply button for one of the jobs I was sent to the site of the of the employer. |
| [theladders.com](https://www.theladders.com/) | 2/5 | The login process also had sso but but the sso integration was not as streamlined as indeed. Next I was asked my name and zip code. Then I was asked what field I wanted to be in for example medical or technology. In the same window you are also asked to select you minium pay and disired job title. On the next page I was asked what my spcialtes where in the technology field.|

| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2  | This site does a good job of asking only the necessary information and nothing else. The only reason I am giving this site a 2 and not a 3 is because it requires an account in order to simply search job as oppossed to showing the jobs and making you create the account when you want to apply to a job.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  | This site showed me only one step at a time which make it very easy and intutive to sign up. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | The site limited you to only a few options buring the start up process so there was npt many other paths to go down. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  | The site was clear and consise with the content of every window. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  | the workflow of the site was very simple and yet it still guided you well thought the process.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  |  This site would work well with a accessible features because it showed you limited information each page and had a minimalistic layout. | |
| **TOTAL** | 20  | Overall the site seems well designed and thoughtout |
