# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [ ] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [ ] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score (1-5) | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| [indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/) | 4/5 | The login process was streamlined with sso google capabilities, next it asked me if I was an employee or a employer, Then it asked me where I was located and what the minium pay I was looking for and what job I was looking for. I was then presented with a list of jobs and when I clicked the apply button for one of the jobs I was sent to the site of the of the employer. |
| [theladders.com](https://www.theladders.com/) | 2/5 | The login process also had sso but but the sso integration was not as streamlined as indeed. Next I was asked my name and zip code. Then I was asked what field I wanted to be in for example medical or technology. In the same window you are also asked to select you minium pay and disired job title. On the next page I was asked what my spcialtes where in the technology field.|

|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | This site is very intuitive it has simple design language that promote the suer for information in clear and concise way. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2  | This site does a good job of asking only the necessary information and nothing else. The only reason I am giving this site a 2 and not a 3 is because it requires an account in order to simply search job as oppossed to showing the jobs and making you create the account when you want to apply to a job.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  | This site showed me only one step at a time which make it very easy and intutive to sign up. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | The site limited you to only a few options buring the start up process so there was npt many other paths to go down. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  | The site was clear and consise with the copy content on every window explaining things like privicay settings. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  | the workflow of the site was very simple and yet it still guided you well thought the process.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  |  This site would work well with a accessible features because it showed you limited information each page and had a minimalistic layout. | |
| **TOTAL** | 20  | Overall the site seems well designed and thoughtout |

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 | This site is intuitive but as soon as the ad for ladders premiu is diplayed it is very unclear how to exit the ad. This is means you must search the web page in order to find the intentiaonly small exit button. |

# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Interaction with Interface |
| Description / Steps | This Use Case demonstrates the different functions that the user can perform when using the system. The user may type a prompt into the chat bot. The user may upload their own API for a custom along with existing AI's. The user is then presented with results of the different responses from the AIs. The user may remove an AI from the interface and add additional at will. |
| Primary Actor | User |
| Preconditions | Assume that the user has logged into the application. |
| Postconditions | The user may view all of the different outputs from each AI simultaneously. |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1.  [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
2.  [Microsoft CoPilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)
3.  [GPT4all](https://gpt4all.io/index.html)
4.  [ChatGot](https://www.chatgot.io/)
5.  [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
6.  [Chatsonic](https://writesonic.com/chat)
7.  [Devin](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin)


## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Define objectives | Creating objectives for the test is necessary in order to define what needs to be accomplished.  |
| 2 | Select users | Users must not have been exposed to the software prior to testing. |
| 3 | Create the test scenario | The test must be prepared in advance in order to evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. |
| 4 | Conduct the test  | Self-explanatory; allow users to interact with the software. |
| 5 | Organize feedback | Gather feedback from the users. Was the software easy to use? Was it intuitive? Was it time consuming? |
| 5 | Report findings | Document all feedback for evaluation; check to see if any common issues occurred. |
| 6 | Improve software | Make the necessary changes based on user feedback. |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Enter a prompt into chat box | the user easily identitiied where the chat box was and it seemed rather straight forward and simple |
| 2 | The user uploads there own API keys for the different chatbots | This coudl be relitively difficult because these API keys are gathered from in a differnt way for each AI model so collecting them as a user could be difficult but once the user has the key from the external site entering the key into our chatbot would be easy.  |
| 3 | View all the results from the AI's all at the same time  |  The user did have trouble seeing the everything all at once I think we could improve this by allowing users to resize windows and pin windows in order to make them more readable. |
| 4 | The user can add and remove AI's from the interface at will | This last step allows the user to have a less cluttered user interface |


## Step 3.5 Findings
Our main findings are that for users to use this tool effectively we will have to make some changes to the interface to have a more simplistic view while not limiting the information displayed to the user. To do this I think we should use a window system and a pinning system. Something like windows in a zoom call.
