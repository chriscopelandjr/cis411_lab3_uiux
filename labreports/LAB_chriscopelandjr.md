# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [ ] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [ ] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score (1-5) | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| [indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/) | 4/5 | The login process was streamlined with sso google capabilities, next it asked me if I was an employee or a employer, Then it asked me where I was located and what the minium pay I was looking for and what job I was looking for. I was then presented with a list of jobs and when I clicked the apply button for one of the jobs I was sent to the site of the of the employer. |
| [theladders.com](https://www.theladders.com/) | 2/5 | The login process also had sso but but the sso integration was not as streamlined as indeed. Next I was asked my name and zip code. Then I was asked what field I wanted to be in for example medical or technology. In the same window you are also asked to select you minium pay and disired job title. On the next page I was asked what my spcialtes where in the technology field.|
